## Introduction

The purpose of this website is to showcase resources that help users learn about budgeting. Users can also plan their budget using the Budget Meter feature to track how much money they are spending on each expense category. This project was created as a part of the required Demo Day presentation for the All-Star Code program. It was presented to sponsors, teachers/instructors, and fellow ASC scholars. The website was developed within a 5-day timeframe.

## Features

Key Features Include:
- Budget Meter: The Budget Meter is a tool that allows users to visualize how much money they are spending compared to their budget. When the budget value approaches zero, the meter turns red to indicate that the user is close to exceeding their allocated budget.
- Expenses: Users can name various types of expenses, such as groceries and leisure items. They can also delete expenses, which will deduct the expense amount from their total budget.
- Budgeting Resources: These resources are linked via URLs and come from trusted sources. Users are encouraged to explore these resources to learn how to start budgeting.
